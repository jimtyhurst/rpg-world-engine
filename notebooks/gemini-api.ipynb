    "\n",
    "1. You need an API key to access the Gemini API.\n",
    "    - See the documentation, \"Get a Gemini API key\", at: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key\n",
    "2. Choose a Gemini model to use.\n",
    "    - See the documentation, \"Gemini models\", at: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini\n",
    "    - They are free (as of 2024-12-29), but they have different rate limits,\n",
    "        token limits, and supported data types.\n",
    "3. Choose an API.\n",
    "    - `google-generativeai`\n",
    "        - We use this API in this notebook.\n",
    "        - https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/\n",
    "        - https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart?lang=python\n",
    "        - This API provides more fine-grained control over model behavior, so\n",
    "            you have greater ability to customize the LLM usage.\n",
    "    - `google-genai`\n",
    "        - We are _not_ using this API in this notebook.\n",
    "        - https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/\n",
    "        - https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/\n",
    "        - This API is more concise and simplified.\n",
    "        - The documentation says, \"Please do not use this SDK in production.\""
