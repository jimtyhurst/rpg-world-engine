    "1. You need an API key to access the Gemini API.\n",
    "    - See the documentation, \"Get a Gemini API key\", at: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key\n",
    "2. Choose a Gemini model to use.\n",
    "    - See the documentation, \"Gemini models\", at: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini\n",
    "    - They have different rate limits, token limits,\n",
    "        and different supported data types.\n",
    "3. Choose an API.\n",
    "    - `google-generativeai`\n",
    "        - We use this API in this notebook.\n",
    "        - https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/\n",
    "        - https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart?lang=python\n",
    "        - This API provides more fine-grained control over model behavior, so\n",
    "            you have greater ability to customize the LLM usage.\n",
    "    - `google-genai`\n",
    "        - We are _not_ using this API in this notebook.\n",
    "        - https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/\n",
    "        - https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/\n",
    "        - This API is more concise and simplified.\n",
    "        - The documentation says, \"Please do not use this SDK in production.\""

Known for:  Bootlegging, Bribery, and missing persons. Current weather:  Cloudy with a chance of betrayal. Humidity:  Saturated with despair. Wind:  Shifting, like the loyalties of a crooked cop.  Visibility:  Obscured by a thick fog of indifference.  Caution:  Beware of dames with secrets, politicians with promises, and anyone who offers you a drink.  It's probably poisoned. Or worse, it's near beer.  This city is a concrete jungle where the predators wear pinstripe suits and the prey carry wallets full of crumpled bills and empty dreams.  It's a place where the only thing you can trust is the gnawing feeling in your gut that tells you everything is about to go wrong.  And it usually does.  Stay tuned for more updates as we follow Detective Harston Cooper's investigation into the disappearance of Roland Robinson.  The trail is cold, the leads are scarce, and the danger is lurking around every dimly lit corner.  This is New Birminghamtonville, where the truth is buried deeper than a Chicago mobster's alibi.  And finding it is about as likely as finding a sober politician on election night.  Good luck, Detective Cooper.  You'll need it.  End transmission.  Static.  Silence.  The sound of a gunshot echoes in the distance.  Fade to black.  The end... or is it just the beginning?  Tune in next week for another thrilling installment of 'The Case of the Missing Robinson.'  Same time, same station.  Don't miss it.  Or else.  Click.  Whirr.  The tape recorder stops.  The detective's office is dark and silent once more.  The only sound is the steady drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet.  A metaphor for the slow, relentless decay of this city.  A city where even the plumbing is crooked.  A city where hope goes to die.  A city called New Birminghamtonville.  Population:  234,432 (and counting down).  Stay tuned.  The story is far from over.  But for now, we fade to black.  The end.  Or is it?  Tune in next week.  Same time.  Same station.  Don't miss it.  Or else.  Click.  Whirr.  Silence.  The city sleeps.  Or does it?  Fade to black.  The end.  For now.  But not forever.  Stay tuned.  The city awaits.  New Birminghamtonville.  Population:  234,432 (and dwindling).  The end.  Or is it?  Tune in next week.  Same time.  Same station.  Don't miss it.  Or else.  Click.  Whirr.  Silence.  Fade to black.  The end.  For now.  Stay tuned.  New Birminghamtonville.  Population:  234,432 (and falling).  The end.  Or is it?  Tune in next week.  Same time.  Same station.  Don't miss it.  Or else.  Click.
