    "name": "Chicago",
    "description": "The wind howled like a banshee down Michigan Avenue, biting through my trench coat and chilling me to the bone. Chicago in '27 was a city of sharp angles and darker shadows, a concrete beast wrapped in a perpetual twilight. The El screeched overhead, a steel serpent slithering through the canyons of brick and steel. Down below, the streets were slick with a mixture of rain and something less savory, a breeding ground for secrets and lies. The newspapers screamed about Al Capone and his South Side boys, but up here on the North Side, the whispers spoke of a different kind of power, a more subtle kind, built on the steady flow of illegal booze and the fat pockets of corrupt aldermen. The air was thick with the smell of coal smoke and desperation.",
    "atmosphere": "Gritty, corrupt, and dangerous. The city is a character itself, a constant presence that presses in on all sides.",
     "mood": "A palpable sense of unease and impending violence. The city feels like it is holding its breath."
