    "{\"player\": {\"name\": \"Jordan Johnson\", \"description\": \"Jordan Johnson was a man etched by the city. His trench coat was rumpled, his fedora slightly askew, and a permanent weariness seemed to cling to his eyes. He was a good, trustworthy private detective, one of the few in this town. But honesty didn't pay the bills in Chicago, especially not in 1927. It had been a while since anyone had walked through his office door with a case, and his rent was starting to weigh on him like the city's oppressive air. Most people around here were not looking for an honest detective. They were looking for someone who could help them hide their dirty laundry, and Jordan just wasn't that kind of man. But he clung to his principles, a flickering candle in the city's unending night.\"}}"
