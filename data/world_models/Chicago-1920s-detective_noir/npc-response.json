        "name": "Dean 'The Hammer' O'Banion",
        "description": "O'Banion, a cold-eyed Irishman with a voice like gravel and a penchant for violence, is the king of the North Side's illegal booze trade. He’s a man who prefers a direct approach, his knuckles doing most of the talking. He’s built like a brick outhouse, and his hands look like they’ve seen more than their fair share of action. You can always spot him by the way his eyes scan a room, looking for threats both real and perceived."

    {
        "name": "Hymie 'The Weasel' Weiss",
        "description": "Weiss, a slender man with sharp features and a nervous energy, is O'Banion's primary rival. His mind is as quick as his hands, and he prefers to operate in the shadows, letting his schemes and double-crosses do the heavy lifting. He's known to be a tricky character, as hard to pin down as a greased pig. You’ll find him in the seedier parts of the North Side, his eyes darting from shadow to shadow."

    {
        "name": "Irving 'The Ledger' Lipshitz",
        "description": "Lipshitz, a balding man with thick glasses and a perpetually worried expression, is O’Banion's accountant. He’s a man who knows the secrets of the books, and he’s not above skimming a little off the top for himself. He's never seen without a ledger and a pencil, and his nervous tic of constantly adjusting his glasses doesn't inspire confidence. It's a safe bet Lipshitz is as crooked as the day is long."

    {
      "name": "Detective 'Sly'  Mikey Malone",
      "description": "Malone, a burly man with a loosened tie and a cynical smirk, is a cop on the take. He's seen enough of the city's underbelly to know that everyone's got a price, and he's not shy about making sure he gets his cut. You can see the corruption in the way he holds his gaze, lingering a second or two too long, assessing you and what you might be worth to him. The city keeps its secrets close, and so does he."
    },
    {
        "name": "Mrs. Lucille Robinson",
        "description": "Mrs. Robinson is a woman of the city's elite. She carries herself with an air of elegance, her every movement graceful, and her clothes scream of money. But behind the polished exterior, there's a hint of boredom and a touch of something colder. She’s the kind of woman who might be more dangerous than any gangster, all the while sipping tea in a grand hotel."

    {
        "name": "Harold Robinson",
        "description":"Harold Robinson is a man of numbers and routine, a creature of habit. As a bank manager, he's built his life on stability and security, but it’s easy to see that the monotony has started to wear on him. He looks like he’d rather be anywhere other than the stuffy confines of his banking world. There is a sadness in his eyes that suggests he might want more out of life than his wife and his bank account offer him."
