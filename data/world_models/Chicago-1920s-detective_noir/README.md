These models were crafted manually as I was experimenting with prompts.
The prompts were submitted to the LLM through a chat web app interface,
rather than through an API.

In the case of places, the response was redistributed, so that each place
appears within a list within a 'neighborhood' element.

The goal is to have a complete world model constructed through a series of
API calls, but I wanted to use the chat app directly, so that I could
experiment with prompts, including 'system instructions' and 'contents', and
verify the results by direct inspection.
